# ICS2210-DSA2-Project

My assignment submission for ICS2210 Data Structures and Algorithms 2 (University of Malta) 2021/2022

Consisted of implementing a deterministic finite state automata and performing actions such as finding the depth, minimisation and finding the strongly connected components of the automata correctly.
